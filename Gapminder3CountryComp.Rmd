This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Comparison of Gapminder Data for Albania, Austria, Costa Rica 
```{r}
summary(cars)
```


```{r}
library("dplyr")

gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep= "\t", header=TRUE)
gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Costa Rica") -> Costa.out

plot(x=Costa.out$year, y=Costa.out$gdpPercap,
     type = "l", # plot as a line plot 
     col = "green", 
     main = "GDPby year", # set title 
     xlab = "Year", 
     ylab = "GDP")
     ```
     





You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
